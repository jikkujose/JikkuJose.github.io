Abstractions that fit our minds like jigsaws are fun to play with. While
building tools, I have often felt state management at the backend is needlessly
complicated especially for very small tasks. Say, a list management or a counter
or even a simple email form.

It's not about the difficulty, but these complicated database setups can drain
the joy from building an idea in just a few hours. Especially with ChatGPT, we
can now give life to an idea that we have been thinking about in practically no
time. So, I wanted to build a tool that speeds up managing small states a
breeze.

> A web store with granular access control. Free. Anonymous. Available
> everywhere.

## Ruby Demo

![Ruby Demo](/assets/ruby-demo.svg)

## Quick Start

Open a browser console & follow along:

#### Import library

``` js
import("https://cdn.toolbomber.com/js/WebArray.min.js")
```

#### Generate keys

``` js
const keys = await WebArray.generateKeys("USE_YOUR_SEED")
```

#### Create instance by passing keys

``` js
const wa = new WebArray(keys)
```

Note: You can skip any of the `read`, `append` or `replace` keys to restrict
the instance from doing the corresponding action.

#### Append

``` js
await wa.append("Mango")
```

#### Read

``` js
console.log(await wa.read())
```

#### Replace

``` js
await wa.replace('Bye!')
```

## Features

- It can do `read()`, `append(item)` & `replace(item)`
- Access can be restricted by removing the specific keys in `webArray.keys`

## Use cases

- Forms
- Email Collectors
- Chat Systems
- Polls
- Surveys
- Feedback Collectors
- Leaderboards
- Status pages

## Apps

- [Parayu](https://parayu.toolbomber.com)

## Examples

### Shortest Backendless Code

Full frontend and backend app in 29 lines of readable code!

/>
<script src="https://cdn.toolbomber.com/js/WebArray.min.js"></script>

<script type="module">
  const fruits = await (await WebArray.create("fruits")).read()

  fruits.forEach(fruit =>
    document.querySelector("tbody").insertAdjacentHTML(
      "beforeend",
      `
      <tr>
        <td>${fruit.name}</td>
        <td>${fruit.updatedAt}</td>
      </tr>
    `
    )
  )
</script>

<table role="grid">
  <tr>
    <th>Fruit</th>
    <th>Unix Time</th>
    <tbody></tbody>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Access Control

WebArray instances requires the `read`, `append` or `replace` keys to do the
specific actions. To prevent a specific action, initialize WebArray using the
keys object excluding the corresponding access key.

Try creating the keys locally, save the seed and use the specific keys required
in the page.

### WebArray.generateKeys(seed)

For instance `keys` can be independently created and used to initialise the client for
fine grained access control.

``` js
const keys = await WebArray.generateKeys("YOUR_UNIQUE_KEY")

delete keys.append
delete keys.replace

const readOnlyClient = new WebArray(keys)
```

## Design Goal

I hope WebArray will be used by folks to test ideas on the fly. It certainly
won't scale, but thats not the point. The trade-off here is rapid prototyping,
as WebArray eliminates 90% of the overhead in setting up a data store, allowing
you to get your idea off the ground in just a few hours.

## Note

- All remote access functions are `async`, do remember to use `await`
- A seed can hold a maximum of 800KB of data.
- Anyone with the seed can read/modify the data
- Not intended to be used for anything critical or even in production
- Planning to open source the code in future
- Regardless of what is used to replace it, WebArray will always return an array.
